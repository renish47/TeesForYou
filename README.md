## Introduction


TeesForYou is a modern E-Commerce website designed for buying a variety of clothing items, including T-Shirts, hoodies, sweatshirts, crop tops, and more. This repository contains the client-side code for the TeesForYou website.

Please note that this project does not include a backend server or database. Instead, we have used a mock API website as our backend server to simulate the required functionality. The project is entirely built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with plans to make it responsive in the future.

### 1. Browse Collections
- Users can browse through our collection based on the type of clothing they desire.
- Users can also filter products based on color.

## To-Do List



We have plans to enhance the TeesForYou website with the following features in the future:

1. **Responsive Design:** Make the website responsive for smaller screens, including mobiles and tablets.

2. **Backend Integration:** Shift the backend logic to proper server-side code instead of relying on the mock API website.

3. **User Authentication:** Implement token-based authentication and store session details in the browser's local storage for a more secure user experience.

4. **Email Verification:** Add email verification using OTP to enhance account security.

5. **Forgot Password:** Implement a "forgot password" functionality on the login page for users to reset their passwords.
